# ðŸ“Š Drug Data Analysis and Prediction Project

## ðŸ§  Overview

This project focuses on *data analysis and prediction* using Python.  

It explores the dataset through visualization, feature analysis, and builds a predictive model to forecast outcomes based on the available data.

The goal of this notebook is to understand data trends, clean and process raw information, and develop a simple but effective predictive model.
